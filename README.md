## Project Summary:

The UK economy is currently facing unprecedented challenges as the ripple effects of recent global shocks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine War, redefine the economic landscape. Inflation has increased beyond anything that we have seen in recent history, and GDP has all but come to a standstill as a result. These crises have also disrupted UK investment dynamics, causing significant fluctuations in investment returns UK sectors, increasing investment risk and lowering investor confidence.

This project seeks to unravel the complexities of how these shocks impact the UK economy and to investigate which macroeconomic factors have the greatest influence on UK investment. By examining these drivers, this report aims to identify their implications for investment strategies, risk management, and long-term growth prospects within the UK.

In an era of uncertainty, understanding these indicators is critical to navigating the ongoing challenges of a volatile global economy and safeguarding the resilience of the UK investment sector. This study aspires to provide actionable insights that empower investors, policymakers, and financial institutions to adapt and survive this shifting economic climate. It will also focus on the UK Collective Investment Scheme (CIS) market, examining the effects of macroeconomic indicators on two key types of investment: direct investments in individual stocks and indirect investments through CIS vehicles such as Open-Ended Investment Companies (OEICs) and Unit Trusts. This distinction highlights the varying ways investors can access the market, either by purchasing shares of individual companies or by pooling their money into professionally managed funds that diversify across multiple assets.

## GDP vs CPI:

When discussing macroeconomic indicators, the first two likely to come to mind for most people are Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which measures the size of a country’s economy[1], and the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is used as a measure of inflation[2]. It is important to note, that often when citing figures for GDP, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) refer to what is called the “Real GDP”[3], which takes inflation into account. Let’s put this information into perspective with the following figures:

This chart shows the trend for both GDP (real) and inflation via the CPI. There are three areas on this chart that stand out:
1.	GDP readjustment in 2008 – A significant drop in GDP that did not recover back to its previous trendline.
2.	GDP drop in 2000 – A unprecedented drop in GDP, however unlike the 2008 drop, GDP returned relatively close to its trendline.
3.	Rapid inflation from 2021 onwards – CPI growth by over 20% in 3 years, essentially causing GDP to stagnate.

These coincide with the three most impactful global economic shocks in recent history:
1.	The 2007-2008 Global Financial Crisis – Despite beginning in 2007, causing the collapse of Northern Rock in the UK, it wasn’t until the collapse of the Lehman Brother investment back on 15 September 2008[4] that the global economy felt the full weight of this shock. 
2.	COVID-19 Pandemic – GDP fell by “More than twice as much as the previous largest annual fall on record” according to the ONS via the BBC[5], following lockdown in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.
3.	The Ukraine War – Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, global oil prices rose by 11%, meanwhile UK wholesale gas prices rose by 40%[6]. Along with other underlying factors and the combination of an already unstable economic condition in the UK following Brexit and COVID-19.
